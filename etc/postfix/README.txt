The main.cf.append file contains the postfix commands needed for bipostal. 
In most cases, you should only need to append the contents of the file
to the end of main.cf. If you already have milters defined, are hosting
mail services on a machine other than localhost, or are using SendMail, 
please refer to the appropriate manual for how to best integrate these
calls.
