BIPostal - BrowserID plugin for Postfix/Sendmail Milter system

See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Notifications/Bipostal for more info

LIBRARIES:
Bipostal requires the following supplemental libraries:
    bipostal_store https://github.com/jrconlin/bipostal_store
    bipostal_dash  https://github.com/jrconlin/bipostal_dash
    ppymilter2     https://github.com/jrconlin/ppymilter2

These libraries are still in development.

GOAL:
Provide semi-anonymous token to username mapping. This is a proof of concept and may be removed.
This presumes integration with a redis database that stores mapped nonse tokens to user emails.

TODO:
Nose tests for milter and mapper (from performace test suite)
